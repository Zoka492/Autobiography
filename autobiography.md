## Early childhood
Autobiography I was born in perfect home. I grew up in a two parent home. I had a fortune to have my grandparents around until the age of 12 when they moved to other apartment. My grandmother played a major role in my early development. She taught me how to read and count. I had lots of toys and she was willing to play with me anything I ever wanted. I was quite creative as a child, so I usually made up some games and we ended up playing it. She also showed me many conventional games like chess, card games, and dominos.

Talking about my grandfather, he worked at a factory, and as I know now he constructed missiles and other military. Because the work he did required precision and patience, love to harmony and order inevitably transposed to our household. He used to store his large collection of tools in a small room, I believe he knew by heart where any object is situated. I always was curious about this room, I was tempted to take a hold of things in there. I can vividly remember now how excited I was about magnets. When I first found a magnet, it attracted my attention because this large piece of metal had a property that other similar objects didn’t have. After I asked anyone I knew to bring me even more of magnets.. I remember I even slept with them. I generally liked all metal stuff such as lockers, chains, taps etc. I think my granddad’s passion about all mechanical objects passed down to me.. Generally, he is an industrious person. His job allowed him to make some minor objects that could be taken home. And I remember the times when he brought some hand made wood and metal things home, like tools, handlers, spoons, bottle tops, etc. I use those things up to these days.

My another grandparents, my father’s parents, both were scientists. Their major subject is physics. They lived separately from us, so they didn’t have that much of an influence on me. Except maybe once, when they presented me a constructor game made of wood. Player is supposed to choose a house from catalog, and build it. And I, at the age of 4, was able to grasp ideas on how to actually do it. Shortly before school I went to school I had begun to figure out my new house projects. My family thought I’ll be an architect. And now I look back and realize how such games contributed to my imagination and creativity. And possibly it is the reason why I have desire and a passion to dream out and build amazing things by myself. All that had made a significant impact on me by the time I went to school.

Surprisingly, I had 2 my first childhood friend lived on the same floor as I did. One of them was about my age and another about 3 years older than me. It appeared like I had always known them. I enjoyed playing with each of them, although they seemingly didn't like each other that much. Sometimes I found myself intermediary between them. I wanted games to be fair to everyone, so we can enjoy it together. It has learned me to communicate my own needs and take into account needs of others.

My parents wanted me to go to kindergarten, but I didn't. Even before I went to school, I despised kindergarten. And I have no idea why.. 

Shortly after my 6th birthday I went to school. 

## School 1-7 grades

It is not like I didn't want to study, but maybe I didn't feel a need to do so.

I have quickly made friends in a class. My classmates were smart and enthusiastic, although no one had good grades. The only subjects that we genuinely enjoyed were Craft and Sport. We had always had fun, no matter what. Regimen, rules, bad marks didn't bother us.  Elementary school teachers failed to be an authority for us.

It lasted well until 6th grade. Because the middle school had started and we got a few new teachers, including new Ukr language and literature teacher. She actually demanded us to learn material and do homework, she was not afraid to write a half of a page complain in dairy, and sometimes contact parents directly.

Since that, everything started to change gradually. And everyone realized that the time had come, and we should to change our attitude towards school, unless we wanted to drop out. It wasn't just a plain school any more, it was a gymnasium; thus they were not obligated to keep such students.

## School 8-9 grades

After 7th grade I came to understand that it is a perfect time to start studying, and I did. It was quite hard to start, I've already wasted so much time. And I didn't have enough of it back then. I was training myself acrobatics intensively, I was passionate about it. And I have made significant achievements there to.

Fortunately, I have managed to put my grades up to an avearage rate at the end of 8th grade. Sooner, I began to progress even more quickly. That was the time when everyone kinda rediscovered the interst in academics, importance of which we had always underestimated. I moved in class ranking dramatically, I was in top 3 and moved to second position at the and of 9th grade.

During 8th grade I realized that mathematics is quite different than other subjects, I came to like it at 9th. And I began to attend additional math lessons. Partially because enjoyed it, and because I had to prepare to final middle school exam. I even started to think whether or not I need to change school, to continue to grow into STEM field. That would be difficult if I had stayed in german gymnaisum because of the lack of qualified teachers. I took some courses that helped me to successfully apply to math-sicence lyciems in my city. There are many of them, but I strongly wanted to go to the best ones. My teacher recomended me to apply to KPNL - best math-physics school in Kyiv. I had passed an interview. Despite my success in the school, I still had many gaps in my knowledge, at some point I was afraid, that I wouldn't be able to catch up with peers, who have spent their entire time with mathematics. Not only was it a big risk, but also it was a challenge.
