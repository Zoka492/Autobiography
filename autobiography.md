## Early childhood
Autobiography I was born in perfect home. I grew up in a two parent home. I had the good fortune to have my grandparents around until the age of 12 when they moved to another apartment. My grandmother played a major role in my early development;she taught me how to read and count. I had lots of toys and she was willing to play with me anything I ever wanted. I was quite creative as a child, so I usually made up some games which we ended up playing. She also showed me many conventional games like chess, card games, and dominos.

 My grandfather worked at a factory, only now I know that  he constructed missiles and other military equipment. Because the work he did required precision and patience, he brought a love of harmony and order to our household. He used to store his large collection of tools in a small room, and I believe that he knew by heart where every object was situated. I was always  curious about this room, I was tempted to explore everything in there. I can vividly remember now how excited I was about magnets. When I first found a magnet, it attracted my attention because this large piece of metal had a property that other similar items didn’t have. Afterwards I asked everyone I knew to bring me even more of magnets.. I remember even sleeping with them. I generally liked all things made of metal such as locks, chains, taps etc. I think my granddad’s passion about all mechanical objects was passed down to me. Generally, he is an industrious person. His job allowed him to make some minor objects that could be taken home. I remember the hand made wooden and metal things he created like tools, handles, spoons, bottle tops, etc. which we continue to use to this day.

My paternal grandparents,  were both physicists. Because they lived separately from us, they didn’t have as much of an influence on me, except maybe once, when they presented me a constructor set made of wood. I chose a house from the catalog to build.  At the age of 4, I was able to grasp ideas on how to actually do it. Shortly before  I went to school I had begun to figure out my new house projects. My family thought I would be an architect. And now I look back and realize how such games contributed to my imagination and creativity. And possibly it is the reason why I have the passion and desire to dream and configure amazing things by myself. All these experiences had  a significant impact on me by the time I went to school.

Surprisingly,  my first 2 childhood friends lived on the same floor as I did. One of them was about my age and another about 3 years older than me. It appeared like I had always known them. I enjoyed playing with each of them, although they seemingly didn't like each other that much. Sometimes I found myself the intermediary between them. I wanted games to be fair to everyone, so we could enjoy them together. It has taught me to communicate my own needs and take into account needs of others.

My parents wanted me to go to kindergarten, but I didn't. Even before I went to school, I despised kindergarten. And I have no idea why.. 

Shortly after my 6th birthday I went to school. 

## School 1-7 grades

It is not like I didn't want to study, but maybe I didn't feel a need to do so.

I  quickly made friends in  class. My classmates were smart and enthusiastic, although no one had good grades. The only subjects that we genuinely enjoyed were Shop and Sports. We had always had fun, no matter what. Discipline, rules, bad marks didn't bother us.  Elementary school teachers failed to be an authority for us.

This happy period lasted well until 6th grade. Then middle school  started and we got a few new teachers, including a new Ukr language and literature teacher. She actually demanded that we learn material and do homework, she was not afraid to write a half of a page complaint in diary, and sometimes contact parents directly.

From that point, everything started to change gradually, and everyone realized that the time had come to change our attitude towards school, unless we wanted to drop out. It wasn't just a plain school any more, it was a gymnasium; thus they were not obligated to keep such wayward students.

## School 8-9 grades

After 7th grade I came to understand that it was a perfect time to start studying, and I did. It was quite hard to start, because I had already wasted so much time. And I didn't have enough of it back then. I was training intensively in acrobatics- I was passionate about it. And I made significant achievements there too.

Fortunately, I had managed to raise my grades to an average level by the end of 8th grade. Soon, I began to progress even more quickly. That was the time when everyone rediscovered their interest in academics, the importance of which we had always underestimated. I moved up dramatically in class ranking; I was in top 3 and moved to second position at the and of 9th grade.

During 8th grade I realized that mathematics is quite different from other subjects, it became my focus in 9th grade.  I began to attend additional math lessons partially because enjoyed it, and partially because I had to prepare for final middle school exam. I even started to think whether or not I need to change schools, in order to specialize in the STEM field. That would have been difficult if I had stayed in the German gymnaisum because of the lack of qualified teachers. I took some courses that helped me to successfully apply to math-science lyceums in my city. There are many of them, but I intensly  wanted to go to the best ones. My teacher recommended me to apply to KPNL - best math-physics school in Kyiv. I passed an interview. Despite my success in school, I still had many gaps in my knowledge, therefore I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to catch up with my peers who had spent their entire time with mathematics. Not only was it a big risk, but also it was a challenge.
